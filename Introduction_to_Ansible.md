### Why Ansible?
Ansible is a popular tool for configuration management and automation due to several key advantages.
Ansibel is designed to handle configurations for a large number of servers efficiently. It works well in both small and large environments, from a few machines to thousands of nodes (servers).
Its architecture allows it to scale without requiring complex infrastructure or additional components. This makes it suitable for diverse environments and use cases, from small development setups to extensive production systems.

#### 1. Simplicity
